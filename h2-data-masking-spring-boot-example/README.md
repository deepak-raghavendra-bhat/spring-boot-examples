### Building

The example can be built with

## Run Spring Boot application

Run application as spring boot app or using command line -> `mvn spring-boot:run`

## Test Spring Boot application

- Please run the below webservice using below command:
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/users' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{ "firstName": "avadhut", "lastName": "lele", "email": "al@gmail.com"}'
